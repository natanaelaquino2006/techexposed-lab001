They then directly deploy their code to the staging environment. However, shortly after deployment, other parts of the application start failing unexpectedly. It turns out their changes introduced new bugs because some automated tests that would have caught the issue were not run, and the deployment process was not consistent, leading to configuration problems in the staging environment that weren't present locally. This causes delays, frustration, and requires rolling back the changes.\n",
